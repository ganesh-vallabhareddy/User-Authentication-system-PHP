# Project Title: User Authentication System using PHP

## Description:
This project implements a basic user authentication system using PHP and MySQL. It allows users to register for a new account, login with their credentials, and access a home page upon successful authentication. The system incorporates features such as user registration with form validation, password encryption, login functionality with error handling, and session management to track logged-in users.

## Features:
- **User Registration:** Users can register for a new account by providing a username, email, and password. The system validates the input fields to ensure all required information is provided.
- **User Login:** Registered users can log in with their username and password. The system authenticates user credentials and grants access upon successful login.
- **Error Handling:** Displays error messages for invalid input or authentication failures during the registration and login processes.
- **Session Management:** Utilizes PHP sessions to manage user authentication and track logged-in users across different pages.

## Usage:
1. Navigate to the project directory in your local server environment.
2. Register as a new user by visiting `register.php`.
3. Log in using your registered username and password at `login.php`.
4. Access the home page at `index.php` after successful login.
